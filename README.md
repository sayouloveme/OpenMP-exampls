# OpenMP Performance Optimization Learning

## Overview
This repository documents my learning process and implementation of OpenMP for parallel programming. I have been using OpenMP to optimize performance in various areas and the following sections summarize the main concepts and techniques I have explored, including:

- `parallel_constructs`
- `private`, `firstprivate`, `shared` clauses
- `loop_constructs`
- `reduction`
- `execution_synchronization`
- `thread_safety`
- `task_constructs`
- `thread_cancellation`

I learned these concepts by directly reading the [OpenMP official documentation](https://bisqwit.iki.fi/story/howto/openmp/#ThreadCancellationOpenmp%204%200) and writing complete example programs from scratch.

## Learning Process

### 1. `parallel_constructs`
- **Purpose**: This construct enables parallel execution of a block of code. The block of code is executed by multiple threads simultaneously.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - `#pragma omp parallel`
  - Thread creation and management

**Example**: Parallelizing a simple loop using `#pragma omp parallel for`.

### 2. `private`, `firstprivate`, `shared` Clauses
- **Purpose**: These clauses control the scope and sharing behavior of variables in parallel regions.
  - `private`: Each thread gets a private copy of the variable.
  - `firstprivate`: Threads get a private copy, but the initial value is the value from the master thread.
  - `shared`: The variable is shared among all threads.
  
**Example**: Using `private` for thread-local variables, `firstprivate` for initializing from master thread, and `shared` for global data.

### 3. `loop_constructs`
- **Purpose**: This construct helps distribute the iterations of a loop among multiple threads.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - `#pragma omp for`: Distributes loop iterations to threads.
  - **Scheduling**: Defines how iterations are assigned to threads (`static`, `dynamic`, `guided`).

**Example**: Parallelizing a loop using `#pragma omp for` and experimenting with different scheduling techniques.

### 4. `reduction`
- **Purpose**: The `reduction` clause is used when performing a computation that involves a shared variable that must be updated in a thread-safe manner.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Avoid race conditions in reduction operations.
  - Common use cases include sum, product, max, min, etc.

**Example**: Using `#pragma omp for reduction(+:sum)` to safely compute the sum of a large array.

### 5. `execution_synchronization`
- **Purpose**: Ensures that threads synchronize their execution at certain points, ensuring correct behavior in parallel programs.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - `#pragma omp barrier`: Synchronize threads at a barrier.
  - `#pragma omp critical`: Protects a block of code so only one thread can execute it at a time.
  - `#pragma omp atomic`: Ensures atomic updates to a shared variable.
  
**Example**: Using `#pragma omp critical` to safely increment a shared counter.

### 6. `thread_safety`
- **Purpose**: Ensures that parallel regions are executed safely without causing data races.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Using `atomic`, `critical`, and `reduction` for thread-safe operations.
  - Proper handling of shared resources.

**Example**: Safe access to shared variables using atomic operations or critical sections.

### 7. `task_constructs`
- **Purpose**: This construct allows for parallelizing blocks of code that can be executed independently.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - `#pragma omp task`: Creates a task that can be executed by any available thread.
  - `#pragma omp taskwait`: Synchronizes tasks.
  
**Example**: Parallelizing recursive functions using `#pragma omp task` to break them into independent tasks.

### 8. `thread_cancellation`
- **Purpose**: Allows threads to be canceled once they complete their work or when a cancellation request is received.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - `#pragma omp cancel for`: Used to cancel threads in a loop.
  - `#pragma omp cancellation point`: Points where threads check if they should terminate early.

**Example**: Using thread cancellation to stop unnecessary work when one thread finds a result.

## Practical Examples
Throughout this process, I hand-wrote examples for each of these concepts. Here are some of the examples included in this repository:

### Example 1: Parallelizing a Simple Loop
```cpp
#include <omp.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int sum = 0;
    #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum)
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        sum += i;
    }
    std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
````

### Example 2: Task Parallelism

```cpp
#include <omp.h>
#include <iostream>

void recursive_task(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return;
    #pragma omp task
    recursive_task(n - 1);
    std::cout << "Task: " << n << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    #pragma omp parallel
    {
        #pragma omp single
        {
            recursive_task(5);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 3: Thread Cancellation Example

```cpp
#include <omp.h>
#include <iostream>

bool found = false;

void search(const char* haystack, char needle) {
    #pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; haystack[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        if (haystack[i] == needle) {
            found = true;
            #pragma omp cancel for
        }
        #pragma omp cancellation point for
    }
}

int main() {
    const char* str = "Hello, OpenMP!";
    search(str, 'M');
    if (found) {
        std::cout << "Needle found!" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Needle not found!" << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

Learning OpenMP and applying it to optimize performance has been an essential part of my journey in parallel programming. These examples showcase my understanding of various constructs in OpenMP, including parallelization, task management, thread safety, synchronization, and cancellation.

Feel free to explore the examples, try different configurations, and experiment with OpenMP in your own projects.
